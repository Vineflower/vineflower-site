Socials
=======

Vineflower's social spaces consists of a Discord guild, Matrix room, and IRC channel, all bridged together as one. Before you join, there are some rules to be read:

1. No hate speech, bigotry, NSFW content, spam, or otherwise unwanted content.
2. Keep on topic if there is on-topic discussion, and don't import drama from other communities.
3. Keep discussions polite and respectful, and avoid meaningless arguments.

Another thing to note, multi-line text doesn't bridge to IRC very well and an image or a paste link would be preferred instead.

Mailing lists
-------------

In addition to social spaces, Vineflower has mailing lists for asynchronous communication and announcements. The primary mailing list is https://vineflower.org/mailing-lists/announce, used for low-volume high-signal announcements such as releases.

In addition, patches can be sent to https://vineflower.org/mailing-lists/devel, and https://vineflower.org/mailing-lists/discuss is available for general queries.
