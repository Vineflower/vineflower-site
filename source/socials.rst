Socials
========

Vineflower's social spaces consists of a Discord guild, Matrix room, and IRC channel, all bridged together as one. Before you join, there are some rules to be read:

1. No hate speech, bigotry, NSFW content, spam, or otherwise unwanted content.
2. Keep on topic if there is on-topic discussion, and don't import drama from other communities.
3. Keep discussions polite and respectful, and avoid meaningless arguments.

Another thing to note, multi-line text doesn't bridge to IRC very well and an image or a paste link would be preferred instead.
